The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several critical phases: planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 
Each phase plays a vital role in ensuring the successful delivery of software products.

1. Phases of SDLC:
Planning: This phase involves defining the project scope, requirements, and objectives. It sets the foundation 
for the entire development process and includes stakeholder engagement to align expectations.
Development: In this phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers implement the functionalities outlined 
in the planning phase. This phase often includes iterative development, where features are built and refined based on continuous feedback.
Testing: Testing is crucial for identifying bugs and ensuring the software meets quality standards. It 
involves various testing methods, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user 
acceptance testing (UAT). Automated testing tools can enhance efficiency and ensure consistency in test coverage.
Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to a production environment where it becomes 
accessible to users. Deployment can be done in stages (rolling deployment) or all at once (big bang deployment), depending on the project's needs.
Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated, patched, and 
improved based on user feedback and changing requirements. This phase is essential for ensuring long-term software reliability and relevance.
