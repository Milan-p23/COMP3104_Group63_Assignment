COMP 3104, the DevOps course at George Brown College, is designed to equip students with the essential skills and knowledge 
needed to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. DevOps, a modern approach to software development, 
emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to improve the efficiency and reliability of software projects. 
In this course, students learn about core DevOps practices such as version control using Git, containerization with Docker, 
continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and cloud-based infrastructure management. 
These tools and techniques are critical for streamlining the development lifecycle, reducing errors, and accelerating deployment.

A key component of COMP 3104 is its focus on automation and scalability, both of which are fundamental to the DevOps mindset. 
Students are introduced to infrastructure-as-code (IaC) practices, where they use tools like Terraform or Ansible to automate 
the provisioning of infrastructure. This allows developers to maintain consistent environments across development, testing, 
and production, minimizing configuration drift and manual errors. The course also covers monitoring and logging tools like 
Prometheus and ELK stack, helping students understand the importance of maintaining a well-monitored, resilient system. 
By mastering these concepts, students are prepared to manage modern cloud environments and large-scale applications.

Beyond the technical aspects, COMP 3104 emphasizes the cultural shift that DevOps brings to organizations. 
Students explore the principles of collaboration between development and operations teams, focusing on breaking 
down silos to create a unified approach to software delivery. The course encourages students to adopt an agile, 
iterative mindset, with a focus on continuous improvement. By the end of the course, students are not only proficient 
in the tools and technologies associated with DevOps but also understand the broader organizational benefits, 
such as faster time to market, improved product quality, and enhanced team collaboration.
