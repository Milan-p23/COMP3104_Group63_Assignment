COMP 3104, the DevOps course at George Brown College, is designed to equip students with the essential skills and knowledge 
needed to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. DevOps, a modern approach to software development, 
emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to improve the efficiency and reliability of software projects. 
In this course, students learn about core DevOps practices such as version control using Git, containerization with Docker, 
continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and cloud-based infrastructure management. 
These tools and techniques are critical for streamlining the development lifecycle, reducing errors, and accelerating deployment.
