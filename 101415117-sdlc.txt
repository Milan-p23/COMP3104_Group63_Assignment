The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic framework that outlines the various phases involved in the creation of software applications. It offers a structured process for planning, designing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software, ensuring that the end product fulfills the defined requirements and adheres to quality standards. The SDLC generally comprises several essential stages:

Requirement Gathering and Analysis: This initial stage focuses on collecting comprehensive requirements from stakeholders, including clients, end-users, and developers. Grasping user needs and business goals is vital for outlining the projectâ€™s scope.

Planning: Once the requirements are understood, the next step is to formulate a detailed project plan that specifies the timeline, resources, and budget necessary for the project. This phase often involves assessing potential risks and developing strategies to mitigate them.

Design: During this phase, architects and developers craft the software architecture and design specifications. This includes outlining the system architecture, user interfaces, and data models, ensuring that the design aligns with the previously gathered requirements.

Implementation (Coding): In the implementation phase, developers begin writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This stage also involves the integration of various modules and components.

Testing: Following the coding phase, the software undergoes thorough testing to detect and fix any defects or bugs. Various testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, are utilized to ensure quality.

Deployment: After testing is complete, the software is launched into the production environment. This phase may also include user training and the creation of documentation.

Maintenance: Once deployed, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues, updated, and improved based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

The SDLC provides a coherent and structured approach, ensuring that software is developed effectively, meets user needs, and is delivered on schedule and within budget.
