COMP 3104 - DevOps is an in-depth course designed to immerse students in the principles and practices of DevOps within the software development landscape. Recognized as a transformative paradigm shift in the IT sector, DevOps emphasizes the seamless integration of development and operations teams, fostering enhanced collaboration, efficiency, and the continuous delivery of high-quality software products. This course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in DevOps methodologies, practices, and the tools necessary to succeed in a rapidly evolving tech environment.

The curriculum delves into key concepts that form the backbone of DevOps, including Continuous Integration (CI), which promotes the regular merging of code changes into a central repository for automated testing and prompt issue identification. Building on this, Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures dependable production releases through automated deployment methods, enabling organizations to deliver features and updates to users quickly and reliably. Furthermore, students explore Continuous Deployment, which automates the release of every change that passes automated tests to production, significantly accelerating the delivery process.

Students gain practical experience with essential tools such as Git for version control, automated testing techniques, and containerization technologies like Docker for packaging applications. The curriculum also introduces orchestration tools like Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications, providing insights into scaling and managing applications effectively in dynamic environments. Additionally, the course incorporates Agile methodologies, highlighting how DevOps fits within broader software development frameworks, promoting iterative development and fast feedback loops.

Through hands-on assignments, students learn to set up CI/CD pipelines, implement automated testing frameworks, and gain insights into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistency and reproducibility across development environments. The course also addresses cloud services like AWS and Microsoft Azure for scalable software delivery, covering topics such as serverless architectures and microservices, which are increasingly relevant in modern application development.

By the conclusion of the course, participants will have developed the skills and knowledge required to effectively implement DevOps practices, preparing them for successful careers in contemporary software development and operations. Graduates will be well-equipped to take on roles such as DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers, and cloud engineers, contributing to organizations' efforts to innovate and improve their software delivery processes while ensuring high availability and performance in production environments.
