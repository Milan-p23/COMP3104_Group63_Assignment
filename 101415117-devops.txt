COMP 3104 - DevOps is an in-depth course aimed at immersing students in the principles and practices of DevOps within the software development landscape. Acknowledged as a significant paradigm shift in the IT sector, DevOps focuses on the smooth integration of development and operations teams, promoting improved collaboration, efficiency, and the continuous delivery of high-quality software products.

The course delves into essential concepts that form the backbone of DevOps, including Continuous Integration (CI), which promotes the regular merging of code changes into a central repository for automated testing and prompt issue identification. Building on this, Continuous Delivery (CD) guarantees dependable production releases through automated deployment methods.

Students gain practical experience with vital tools such as Git for version control, automated testing techniques, and containerization technologies like Docker for packaging applications. The curriculum also introduces orchestration tools like Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications.

Through hands-on assignments, students learn to set up CI/CD pipelines and gain insights into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to improve consistency. Moreover, the course addresses cloud services such as AWS and Microsoft Azure for scalable software delivery.

By the conclusion of the course, participants will have developed the skills and knowledge required to effectively implement DevOps practices, equipping them for successful careers in contemporary software development and operations.
